^ if the script doesnt detach sleep + commands then closing terminal fucks up clean up
assuming the gnupg0 link was hax to get symlinks to actually match sdXZY devices ? if it disapears it doesnt write anything so 

right so lastish thing... probably about the 17,000th time ive said that... : /

sleep rm all the things & < - closing terminal kills background

needs ( ( commands) & ) & ?
dumping ( commands & ) & backgrounds the last command and fucks the sleep dep ie insta delted /tmp


right so udev is sucky...
execute then plug is... versatile 

totally fucked myself over with the whole random uid:gid
^ oneshot call... do a tmp unlock or call and dir dive /tmp/mount... < - script some path foo to setup atleast quick access to importing + whatever 

basically no 222 no easy dev to do anything 

/mnt/
  luks
  rawfs
  mount

+

hotplug

dump default paths to wrapper foo then ./anything name 
auto append to path 
./stats - dump number of rawfs number of keys match keys to rawfs dump individual sizes + combined / total space 

^ /mnt/mount - everything that gets a call cleans up empty dirs.... possibly going to fuck everything up miss matched greps == bye bye raw image

mount | grep "/mnt/mount/name " trailing space fixed loads of other problems 

functions to setup usbs are pretty much a no go...

tune2fs -l ${DEV} | grep Block
block count * block size - 100 erm dd /dev/sdd2 starts 0-end of partition
