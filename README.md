# backups_

well everything was working then everything exploded 
havent done any real work for a few weeks totally burnt out 

entire setup for anything productive was based on functionality that broke so /shrug 

but about time i did something useful again 

fixing usb bootable network intergration lan will be easy / pretty quick throw up more for debugging key exchanges
cant really wan without actual remote and im a skint unemployed hobo so thats not happening any time soon but ive got pages of theory for the setup i want so wouldnt take long anyway 

<3 OLD=$(stat -c %U $(tty);chown ${USER}:tty $(tty);echo stub;chown ${OLD}:tty $(tty)

updated arch iso and now every bridge interface has a bridge@NONE and bridge_interface@ifXYZ tried searching no idea what even updated that : / pushed to many times to try and track it
and my google foo failed
^ but it all still works networking wise anyway actually booting containers is totally fucked wouldnt even be worth explaining work arounds 

webpanel, was working on it pretty hard then everything died to so fuck knows havent touched it in about 2 weeks and it died as i was working on it epic : /

dropped minimal and went bloat because im apperently getting radio foo delivered for the hackrf cant even remember buying it : / 


meh pretty much backups incase i loose everything moving raw images and keys over
